# scGET
**s**ingle **c**ell **G**enome and **E**pigenome by **T**ransposases sequencing (**scGET**-seq) aims to discriminate between open accessible chormatin regions and closed compacted chromatin regions within each single cell, taking advantage of two different transposases: transposase to sequence accessible chromatin (*tn5*) and a chimeric form of tn5 (*tnh*), which binds compacted chromatin.


The workflow for analysis of scGET-generated data is based on the Snakemake: a workflow management system, which guarantees the possibility to parallelize independent jobs. In particular, scGET workflow is described by the image below.
